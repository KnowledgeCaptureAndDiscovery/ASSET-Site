										Although highly advanced cyberinfrastructure tools are available to scientists, in many cases they have not seen broad use across science domains. In part, this is due to a knowledge gap in which the cyberinfrastructure experts are keenly aware of how tools could benefit scientists and dramatically improve their productivity, but scientists may lack awareness or are often disconnected from the technical details of what the relevant tools are and how to integrate them into their science workflows.
									</p>
									<p>
										EarthCube’s Accelerating Scientific Workflows using EarthCube Technologies (ASSET) project will build strong, sustainable relationships among cyberinfrastructure experts and geoscientists through an informed and collaborative examination of their current workflows and the integration of existing tools.  ASSET is developing a framework to capture scientific workflows in different domains of geosciences, characterize the type of work and the amount of effort involved in each activity, and map workflow activities to available tools and infrastructure.
									</p>
									<p>
										The ASSET workflow sketching interface enables scientists to specify their workflows and describe the steps involved, their dependencies, current tools used, current duration, and other important aspects of a scientist’s workflow.  Scientists will be trained on reproducibility and how this can be achieved through capturing their workflows and tracking provenance of workflow execution results.
									</p>
									<p>
										The ASSET project will examine two geoscience use cases (hurricane risk and water resources) in detail and assign cyberinfrastructure experts to integrate EarthCube tools into these science workflows, to demonstrate the increases in productivity that are realized. Additional use cases will be based on a series of ASSET “clinics” at major geosciences conferences and institutions to collect additional use cases from the community, where geoscientists will describe their workflows and receive personalized advice on the use of cyberinfrastructure tools.
